Hello! I'm Muhamad Fadhil Mulyana, a passionate web developer and UI/UX designer. I specialize in creating visually appealing, user-friendly, and responsive websites. My journey in technology started at a young age, and I have continually developed my skills in front-end development, database management, and design.
I am currently pursuing a degree in Informatics at Pembangunan Jaya University, where I combine my love for technology with a focus on problem-solving and creativity. I also have a strong interest in graphic design, which complements my web development skills and helps me create intuitive user experiences.
When I'm not coding or designing, I enjoy exploring new technologies, learning about the latest trends in web development, and challenging myself with new projects. I believe that technology is constantly evolving, and I strive to stay at the forefront of those changes.
Feel free to explore my portfolio to see the projects I've worked on and don't hesitate to reach out if you'd like to collaborate!
